Insertion Sort - Algorithm used to sort information, with order of growth O(n²). In the algorithm we begin to index 0 and go through comparing the current data with the previous one, swap the data if the comparing one is smaller than the other one. Keep doing this and in the end, the array is sorted.
Selection Sort - Algorithm used to sort information, with order of growth O(n²). In the algorithm we search for the smallest data and put it in index 0, the second smaller, in index 1, in the end the array is sorted.
